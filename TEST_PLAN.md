# Burnout Prediction Project: Test Plan and Hypothesis

This document outlines the testing strategy and core hypothesis for the employee burnout prediction model.

## 1. Core Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:** It is possible to accurately predict an employee's burnout rate (a continuous value between 0.0 and 1.0) by leveraging a combination of demographic, organizational, and self-reported psychological data.

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
-   **H1: Feature Importance:** `Mental Fatigue Score` and `Resource Allocation` are the most significant predictors of burnout.
-   **H2: Model Superiority:** An optimized XGBoost model will outperform baseline models due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
-   **H3: Data Preprocessing:** A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline—including outlier capping, robust missing value imputation, and feature scaling—is critical for achieving high model accuracy and generalization.

## 2. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy is divided into several key areas to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and robustness of the model from data ingestion to final prediction.

### 2.1. Data Validation and Integrity Testing

**Objective:** To ensure the quality and integrity of the input data (`train.csv`, `test.csv`).

| Test Case | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Loading** | Script can successfully load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files. | No `FileNotFoundError` or parsing errors. DataFrames are created with the expected number of rows and columns. |
| **Schema Check** | Verify that all expected columns are present in the loaded data. | All columns (`Employee ID`, `Gender`, `Designation`, etc.) are present and correctly named. |
| **Data Type Check** | Validate that each column has the expected data type (e.g., `Date of Joining` as object/string, `Designation` as numeric). | No unexpected data types that would cause failures in preprocessing steps. |
| **Missing Value Threshold** | Check if any column has an unexpectedly high percentage of missing values (e.g., > 50%). | A warning is raised if a column exceeds the missing value threshold, as it may be unusable. |

### 2.2. Preprocessing Logic Testing

**Objective:** To verify that each step of the data preprocessing pipeline functions correctly.

| Test Case | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Categorical Encoding** | `Gender`, `Company Type`, and `WFH Setup Available` are correctly converted to binary (0/1) columns. | Original columns are dropped, and new binary columns (`is_male`, `is_service`, `wfh_available`) are created with correct values. |
| **Missing Value Imputation** | `Resource Allocation` and `Mental Fatigue Score` have no missing values after `handle_missing_values()` is run. | The number of `NaN` values in these columns is zero. Imputed values should be reasonable (e.g., not infinite or extreme). |
| **Outlier Capping** | Verify that values in `Resource Allocation` and `Mental Fatigue Score` are capped within the IQR-defined bounds. | The min/max values of the processed columns should not exceed the calculated lower and upper bounds. |
| **Feature Scaling** | Numerical features are standardized (mean ~0, std ~1) **without** affecting the target variable (`Burn Rate`). | The `Burn Rate` column should retain its original scale (0-1). Other numeric features should have a mean close to 0. The scaler object is saved correctly. |
| **Train/Test Consistency** | The preprocessing pipeline can be applied to the test set using the state (e.g., scaler) from the training set. | The test set is processed without errors and has the same final feature columns as the training set. |

### 2.3. Model Performance and Evaluation Testing

**Objective:** To evaluate the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of the trained model.

| Test Case | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Training** | The XGBoost model trains successfully on the preprocessed data without errors. | A trained model object is created. |
| **Performance Metrics** | The model achieves a validation R² score above a predefined threshold (e.g., **0.85**). | The `Validation R²` in the evaluation output meets or exceeds the target. |
| **Overfitting Check** | The difference between the training R² and validation R² is minimal (e.g., < 0.1). | The model is not severely overfitting. The "Overfitting check" in the evaluation output passes. |
| **Prediction Range** | All predicted `Burn Rate` values on the test set are within the valid range of [0.0, 1.0]. | No predicted values are less than 0 or greater than 1. |
| **Hyperparameter Optimization** | The `optimize_model` function runs without errors and returns a set of best parameters. | The Optuna study completes, and a dictionary of hyperparameters is returned. |

### 2.4. Edge Case and Robustness Testing

**Objective:** To ensure the prediction pipeline is robust to unexpected or edge-case inputs.

| Test Case | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single Employee Prediction** | The `predict_single_employee` function correctly handles a valid input. | A valid burn rate and risk category are returned without errors. |
| **Input with All Nulls** | A data row where all numeric features are null is passed to the prediction pipeline. | The pipeline should handle this gracefully (e.g., by imputing all values) and produce a valid, non-error prediction. |
| **Extreme Values** | An input with values outside the typical range (e.g., `Mental Fatigue Score` of 15) is provided. | The model should still produce a prediction, ideally capped within the [0,1] range, demonstrating robustness. |

## 3. Success Criteria

The project will be considered a success if the following criteria are met:
1.  **Primary Goal:** The final model achieves a **Validation R² score of 0.90 or higher**.
2.  **Generalization:** The model shows low overfitting, with a train-validation R² difference of less than 0.05.
3.  **Robustness:** All test cases in the plan pass successfully.
4.  **Reproducibility:** The entire pipeline, from data loading to prediction, can be run end-to-end without manual intervention and produces consistent results.
